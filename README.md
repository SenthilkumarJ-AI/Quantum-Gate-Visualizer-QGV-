# Quantum-Gate-Visualizer-QGV-
A simple and interactive quantum computing tool that helps visualize:  - Quantum gate matrices   - Eigenvalues &amp; eigenvectors   - Gate action on |0⟩ and |1⟩ Bloch sphere representation Auto-generated quantum circuits This project is designed for students, beginners, and educators to understand quantum gates visually using Qiskit + Jupyter Widgets
